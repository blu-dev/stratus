# stratus - Mod Loader for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate

Stratus is the spiritual successor to [ARCropolis](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis).

ARCropolis, while driving the SSBU Modding scene for years now, suffers from a legacy codebase that is difficult to maintain.

## Improvements over ARCropolis
- Uses less memory overhead for hash lookups for logging using [smash-hash](https://github.com/blu-dev/smash-hash)
- More to be written later (ghidra was analyzing something while I was writing this)

## Why `stratus`
`stratus` was the WIP modloader named used by [Shádow](https://github.com/shadowninja108) before [Raytwo](https://github.com/Raytwo) and [jam1garner](https://github.com/jam1garner) carried the torch and implemented `ARCropolis`.

We've chose to name the modloader in his honor since he wrote [skyline](https://github.com/shadowninja108) (the code injection framework used by HDR, ARCropolis, and now stratus).
